# ACQUIRING CONFIDENCE BEFORE AN AUDIENCE
    
    We all often experience strange sensation in the presence of audience .
    we need to practice in order to overcome self-consciousness and the fear that paralyzes us before audience.
    PRACTICE in speaking before an audience will tend to remove all fear of audiences .we need to learn to speak by speaking.

## BE ABSORBED BY YOUR SUBJECT
 	If you know about your subject your subject you will be able to think of something.
	Concentration is important in order to not get distracted from less important matters..
	Self-consiousness is important.
	
## HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
	Donâ€™t go to speak without preparing having minds a blank.
	We all need to have something in which we are confident.
  Have the first few sentences worked out completely so that you may not get trouble during beginning of speech.
	Know your subject better then your hearers.

## AFTER PREPARING FOR SUCCESS, EXPECT IT
  If you believe you will fail,there is no hope, you will.
  Have faith in ourselves.
  Anyone who thoroughly knows himself must feel true humility.
