    Monotonous is having one tone and lack of variation.
    Monotonous speakers have same volume and pitch of tone and also they have same emphasis,same speed,same thoughts.
    Monotony is problem for public speakers . We have left undone those things that are to be done.
    All the thoughts should not be expressed in the same manner.We need to show variation from one thought from another.
    As a speaker , we need to use all the powers not having a thought that rest of the power are not developed.
    Monotony reveals our limitations.
    We need to strive to increase the variety of our speech.
    We can avoid monotony by multiplying powers of speech.
    We can increase powers of speech by increasing the tools
## " practice helps in learning to use the tools we have "
    The most important law of public speech is truth,force,feeling,life.
    When you  have ability to apply them , you will have great variety in your powers.
    To have that we need to PRACTICE.
    If no one will listen to you, listen to yourself.
    Be natural,untill you have reached the ideal.
